      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Rio de Janeiro, the marvelous city. It is like no other in the world, stunningly beautiful, brimming with life and passion.</p>
      <p>Here, you can have it all: from a laid-back beach and surfer lifestyle to world-class restaurants; from enriching cultural offerings to untouched nature and mountain hikes.</p>
      <p>It’s a city of contrasts, two worlds in one, and as a newcomer it can be hard to navigate. Even more than in other metropolises, dangers abound. From tourist traps to active war-zones within city limits, it is not for the faint of heart!</p>
      <p>Nowhere else is it so crucial to be guided, to know where to go and what to avoid. There is so much to do, so much to see, it can get overwhelming quickly. I’m here to help you make the most of your stay and fall in love with this incredibly exciting place.</p>

    <!-- Safety -->
    <section id="safety" class="safety-container">
      <h2>Safety</h2>
  <p>Alright, this is a complicated topic, but one that needs to be addressed. You probably already know Rio isn’t the safest city in the world, but it’s also not as bad as it’s sometimes portrayed.</p>

<p>I hope I can shed some light on the issue, and help you feel safe and at ease during your stay here.</p>

<p>I know what I’m talking about regarding this topic, because as a very obvious, light-skinned and green-eyed gringo, who had quite a rocky start when he came here in 2018, I was determined to understand the dynamics of violence in Rio de Janeiro and learn how to stay safe, which is not as difficult as it might seem.</p>

<p>If you want to dive deep into the subject, I wholeheartedly recommend the book <em>Drugs and Democracy in Rio de Janeiro</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, before I begin, I want to reiterate one thing. Your penthouse is arguably in one of the safest, if not the safest, areas of Rio de Janeiro. So none of the tips or cautions I write down below apply here.</p>

<p>You can walk around Vidigal completely safely at any time of day or night with your phone, jewelry, etc. Nothing will happen to you.</p>

<p>To understand why, I need to elaborate a bit,  
  <a id="expandLink" href="#" onclick="toggleMore(); return false;">
    click here if you want to know more
  </a>:
</p>

<div id="more" style="display: none;">
  <p>Ok, so Rio de Janeiro is geographically and spiritually split into two parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parts that are under governmental control</li>
    <li>Parts that are not under governmental control</li>
  </ul>
<p>The parts not under state control are called favelas, or rather, more politically correct, communities. They came into being at the end of the 19th century, when soldiers who fought in the war against Paraguay came home with nowhere to live, and began to inhabit the hills of Rio de Janeiro. The abolition of slavery accelerated their growth, and today, they are home to a large part of the population.</p>

<p>There have been various attempts by the state to regain control of or abolish the favelas, but these have proven unsuccessful. To expand on that would go too far here, there are many factors at play, but it is sufficient to say that the people who live there are important, cheap workers for the richer neighborhoods, and the crime that happens there feeds into a deeply ingrained, self sustaining system within the state that fights said crime, thereby also creating and maintaining jobs. Basically, any effort to get rid of favelas only makes them stronger, and lacks political will.</p>

<p>The parts under state control are informally called asphalt. The problem, however, is that the government struggles to guarantee safety in these areas, just as it does in other big cities worldwide.</p>

<p>The situation in Rio is more complicated because, due to areas with no state influence, crime grows undisturbed, and the favelas provide a safe haven for criminals. It is exacerbated by the vast wealth disparity that plagues Rio, or rather, Brazil.</p>

<p>Because of limited funding, the police are mostly deployed in the rich areas, like the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro, where you will probably stay for most of your visit, whereas the North Zone sees significantly less policing and, therefore, more crime. The vast majority of favelas are also located in the North Zone. To further complicate things, they are controlled by different criminal organizations that frequently fight each other to expand their power, and this is where most of the ugly imagery of violence in Rio comes from.</p>

<p>For reasons also too complicated to explain here, the criminal groups in Rio are ridiculously well armed, with access to literal weapons of war. It is not uncommon to see videos of some 15 year old kid shooting missiles at a police helicopter, or day long shootouts with machine guns, between rival gangs.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, those suffering most from this violence are the working class people who live in these areas, and fear being struck by stray bullets. There is even an app <a href="https://www.ondetemtiroteio.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ondetemtiroteio.com/login</a> that warns you about ongoing shootings, so you can avoid the area on your way to work. You, as a tourist, will have no contact with this type of problem.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that, mostly in the newer East part of Rio, another split happened, leading to yet another divide in the city. Basically, due to the lack of public safety in these areas, a militia of former and current policemen, firefighters, and civilians took matters into their own hands, and began patrolling the streets to protect residents from attempts by drug gangs to take over.</p>

<p>Only over time, these militia groups began to act exactly like the criminal groups, extorting businesses for protection, selling overpriced energy and gas to residents, and even selling drugs themselves. So now, you have state controlled areas (South Zone), gang ruled favelas (largely in the North Zone), and militia ruled areas in the East Zone, everyone fighting each other.</p>

<p>A big problem, and explanation for danger in state controlled areas, is the leniency criminals benefit from in the justice system. Oftentimes, the police catch criminals, who are then released on bail by a judge. Many violent crimes are committed by minors, who cannot be tried or sentenced as adults here, no matter how heinous the crime. But even for adults, there is no life in prison sentence in Brazil; only recently, a violent gang leader got out because his wife had cancer, and he was already old.</p>

<p>Every Christmas, a large part of imprisoned criminals are allowed to go home for a week, with many not returning afterward.</p>

<p>Only recently, a gang leader in a dangerous favela was killed in an operation, and he had 200 criminal records already.</p>

<p>For this reason, state controlled areas are so dangerous, the state has no real control, and criminals roam freely, hunting for prey. While the high presence of police in the rich areas acts as a deterrent, it does not address the roots of the problem, and therefore, cannot resolve public security issues. Though I must say, the new administration announced a budget of several hundred million BRL to fight crime, and when looking at the statistics, things have improved over the last decades, so there is hope. For now, however, it is important to be aware and adapt to the situation, which will allow you to enjoy a safe and happy holiday.</p>

<p>But I actually wanted to tell you why, the area where you live is so safe. First of all, the penthouse is not really located inside the favela. It shares one entrance, and the formal address Vidigal, but it is not on the favela hill. Regardless, the favela is close by, offers various points of interest for tourists, and might be fun to explore. So here I am explaining the dynamics in this favela, specifically, which also affect the penthouse area, as the outskirts of the community.</p>

<p>Vidigal, and some other favelas in the South Zone, are in a unique situation, where they serve as distribution hubs for drugs, destined for the rich people, and tourists in the South Zone. As you can imagine, there is a lot of money to be made, so these places do not need other sources of income, such as robberies on the asphalt, robberies never take place inside the favelas, only outside, and the favelas serve as home bases, so to speak.</p>

<p>When pacification happened, and the police moved into the favelas in Vidigal, they actually managed to stay and coexist with the drug traffickers. Because of the absence of other crimes, there was less, or no, public pressure to abolish these groups, and instead, the police turned a blind eye to the drug trade, and perhaps actually profited from it, too, but I do not want to allege corruption, although it is said they earn the majority of the profit from these trades.</p>

<p>Over the years, they pushed back against the ruling gang, and today, we have a situation where the state actually has decent control over the area. There is waste management, illegally parked cars are removed, illegal constructions are not tolerated, etc.</p>

<p>I briefly mentioned that robberies never happen inside the favela, and this is because the local gangs do not tolerate crime, and because they do not abide by the rule of law, which is often weakly enforced in state controlled areas, they have much more effective means of punishing crime. In other words, in a favela, there is zero tolerance for crime committed against residents, and it is enforced much more effectively than the state would. The biggest danger in a favela is a war with other gangs trying to take over, but in Vidigal, you do not have this problem, because the criminal gang is collaborating with the police, which essentially means all three forces I mentioned here, state controlled, gang controlled, militia controlled, combine into one.</p>

<p>Which makes it extremely unlikely that a takeover attempt would take place.</p>

<p>To summarize, you have 24/7 police presence, locally enforced laws that prohibit any kind of violence or theft, and a firm administration keeping unwanted people, homeless crack addicts, out effectively.</p>

<p>On top of that, Vidigal became a hot tourist attraction, starting with its famous and amazing Dois Irmãos Trail, with the best view of Rio, and sprawling from there, with Bar Laje viewpoint restaurant, Bar Abrão numerous events, and the latest addition, the great breakfast spot Café e Mar.</p>

<p>So, the residents are not only accepting, but also welcoming of tourists, and you will enjoy a special status there, and will be met with warmth and open arms.</p>

<p>Just be aware that you should not film aside from the main road, after all, it is not a zoo, but a home to ordinary people, actually, it is home to many artists, and you will find a lot of graffiti and wall murals all over the favela.</p>

      No straight to the dangers that actually await you outside of Vidigal, and how to prevent them:

      
        <li>Don't use any kind of expensive looking jewelry/watches.</li>
        <li>Keep your phone in your pocket unless you are aware of your surroundings (it is fine to use on the beach etc to take photos but be aware of your surroundings, and don't walk around mindlessly with phone in the hand).</li>
        <li>Backup your phone data, or even better leave it at home or bring a cheaper phone to use on the street.</li>
        <li>If you are unlucky and fall victim to an assault/robbery attempt, do not resist. Give up your phone/belongings. They will want you to unlock your phone too. So best to not have bank account apps installed.</li>
        <li>Please, this is really important. Anytime something bad happens it is because the victim tries to fight back/keep the phone.</li>
        <li>These people have nothing to lose and will shoot you or stab you without hesitation if you do not cooperate.</li>
        <li>However, if you stay in the tourist areas, you will be fine... Risk for petty theft is much higher, so just be smart about your surroundings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to go somewhere, you can tell me and I will offer advice. Eg, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Arpoador+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arpoador</a> is an amazing sunset spot (your apartment is the best sunrise spot – I really recommend to wake up at 6 one day and enjoy it!). There is also a street market, often live music, free yoga in the morning – a magical spot. But it should be avoided on weekends at around 4 pm to 7 pm, because it gets very crowded with youths from bad districts...</p>
      <p>When you go out, don't bring anyone home (it is also not allowed/possible to bring unregistered visitors back to the apartment – for safety reasons). There are Motels all around where people meet for casual encounters – much safer.</p>
      <p>Always watch your drink. When you go to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Lapa+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lapa</a>, don't wander around the side streets.</p>
      <p>Generally, it is always good to stay where there are many people, don't walk around empty streets (especially in the center / Copacabana / Leblon / Ipanema is less risky).</p>
      <p>When you are out and about at night take <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Uber+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taxis / Uber</a> even for short distances...</p>
      <p>Again, none of that applies to where you live and the surrounding area, there you can be completely relaxed. No robberies, no assaults, no thefts will happen here.</p>
      
      <section id="paysafe">
      <p><strong>Payment Safety</strong></p>
      <p>Regarding payments and possible overcharging scams, you will notice that basically everyone accepts credit cards, but unfortunately there are scammers out there who will manipulate or hide the screens of the paying devices and overcharge you for their goods / services. This happens more often in the more touristy areas, like Copacabana, but you should always be aware.</p>
      <p>The best to avoid this type of scam is by not using your credit card at all in cases where you could not return to / find the merchant who you paid. In other words, to only use your card in businesses with a permanent location.</p>
      <p>If you do use your card with street vendors it is best to deactivate the contactless pay option, and take the payment device into your hand, insert the card yourself, and verify the correct amount to be paid on the display before you confirm the payment.</p>

    <!-- Vidigal -->
    <section id="vidigal">
      <h2>Vidigal</h2>
      <p>Vidigal is a small peaceful pacified community on the hill of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gnZAf5EZCjTrGc7J6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morro Dois Irmãos</a>, with amazing views of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>It is the first community that became a hot tourist destination, not least because of the famous hike in a national park up to the top of the hill.</p>
      <p>It is a relatively easy hike of about 30–40 minutes if you start at the official entrance point.</p>
      <p>To go there you can take a moto-taxi or minivan (≈ R$ 10 per person).</p>
      <p>You can also walk up from the bottom at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pra%C3%A7a+do+Vidigal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Praça do Vidigal</a>, which is considerably harder, doubling the time to the top of the mountain.</p>
      <p>Personally, I prefer walking it this way—the path is easy to find (just follow the one main road), and when in doubt ask one of the friendly locals.</p>
      <p>Entrance fee to the hike is R$ 10 per person.</p>
      <p>It is really worth starting the hike when it is still dark so you can enjoy the most spectacular sunrise of your life.</p>
      <p>The views from up there are truly stunning at any time—it is the best viewpoint in Rio.</p>
      <p>Best time to visit is during the week, as on weekends it sometimes gets crowded.</p>
      <p>On the way down, grab a snack (coxinha—a fried doughball filled with chicken) and an açaí, then go straight to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/18JwPSHCMKjGqd4n9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vidigal Beach</a>, where you can wash away the sweat with a dip in the ocean.</p>
      <p>It is a very safe beach and still something of a secret (though that’s changing fast), very different from the buzzing shores of Ipanema or Copacabana.</p>
      <h3>Other things to do in Vidigal:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafeemar.vdg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Café e Mar</a> – amazing breakfast spot; reserve in advance.</li>
        <li><a href="https://bardalaje.rio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bar da Laje</a> – rooftop with food & drinks (cover ≈ R$ 80 pp).</li>
        <li><a href="https://mirantedoarvrao.com.br/wp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirante do Arvrão</a> – live music, DJs, events.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </section>

      <section id="gettingaround">
 <h3>Walking</h3>
<p>The best choice when visiting the nearby beaches. Please be careful with the mototaxis in front of the condominium. Due to Vidigal’s popularity there are quite a few these days, especially when there are special events, and they are sometimes not very considerate of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Please be aware that, for some reason, Google Maps does not show the correct walking path or distance from the apartment. It instead routes you on a walking trail. You can easily and quickly access Leblon via Avenida Niemeyer, despite what Google shows.</p>

<h3>Taxi vs Uber</h3>
<p>I personally prefer taxis here in Rio because Ubers are often run down, old and at times not very reliable. Taxis are abundant, still affordable and offer a better experience. However, always make sure the driver activates the taxi meter and do not accept fixed prices. There are taxis stationed at Praça do Vidigal almost at all times.</p>

<p>When you want to return to the apartment, say:</p>
<p><em>“Estrada do Vidigal, 90, Edifício Costa Azul.”</em></p>
<p>Sometimes drivers confuse the address and think they have to go up the favela hill, which they do not like because it is narrow and has lots of traffic. If they hesitate or try to drop you off at Praça do Vidigal just say:</p>
<p><em>“Esse endereço não está na subida da favela; é um condomínio. Por favor, me leva até a porta, o Google mostra o endereço certo.”</em></p>

<p>If you prefer using Uber be aware that Uber generally does not pick you up at the condominium but waits at Praça do Vidigal. If you require them to pick you up at the condominium because of luggage or other reasons you can incentivize them by offering a tip, for example 15 BRL. Write them:</p>
<p><em>“Por favor, me busca na porta do condomínio. Não está na subida da favela, procura Edifício Costa Azul no Google Maps. Eu vou te dar um gorjeta de 15 reais.”</em></p>
<p>When returning to the apartment you can replace <em>busca</em> with <em>leva</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that on weekdays until 10:30 am Avenida Niemeyer becomes a one lane road in the direction of Leblon, so returning by car will require a detour.</p>

<h3>City Bike</h3>
<p>About eight minutes from the penthouse on Avenida Niemeyer toward Leblon there is an Itaú Bike station where you can rent bikes and electric bikes. You can register with your credit card or use the Uber app. It is a great way to explore the city. You pick up the bike and drop it off at one of the numerous locations all over town. The locations are visible in the app or on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Always make sure the bike works before getting on it. If you want an electric bike you might have to get up early and check the map in the app to see where one is available. You can then grab a normal Itaú bike to hunt for the e-bike. They are not easy to find these days but it might be worth it if you plan a long ride. For example, you could ride to Recreio along the beach, starting early because it will be quite hot.</p>
<p>Or you can go to Flamengo Beach near the city center. Just be extra careful between Copacabana’s tunnel and Flamengo because the risk of assaults is higher there than in Leblon or Ipanema.</p>

<h3>Buses / Vans</h3>
<p>At Praça do Vidigal you have buses and vans going to every part of the city. However, buses can be inconvenient because they are often crowded, loud and not comfortable. Depending on where you go (centro) there is also a risk of assaults on the bus. </p>
  
  <p>Vans are a quick and easy way to get to Leblon or Ipanema beach. They depart every couple of minutes and are inexpensive (about 5 BRL, cash only).</p>
<p>When you want to get off simply shout:</p>
<p><em>“Desce.”</em></p>

<h3>Metro</h3>
<p>The metro is a great and safe way to get around the city, especially during rush hour to beat traffic. The payment card, which you can buy and recharge at the station, can also be used for vans and buses. There is even a promotion if you use a van and the metro in one trip.</p>
<p>The closest metro station is in Leblon, called Antero de Quental (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zm8Am6eD5DRJfh8y7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map link</a>). It’s best to take a van, ask for:</p>
<p><em>“metro, por favor,”</em></p>
<p>and the driver will let you off at the beach. Then you can walk a few minutes to the station.</p>

<h3>Private driver</h3>
<p>If you want a private driver I can organize one for about 600 BRL for six hours in an Uber Black type of car. For an armoured vehicle it would be about 1200 BRL for six hours. Availability may vary.</p>

<h3>Going up the favela</h3>
<p>If you want to go up the favela you can walk (difficult but a proper workout) or use a mototaxi or a van. The mototaxi is the most adventurous option but also the most dangerous. You can ask for a helmet, which is generally not offered without request, but rides can still be wild and unsafe.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the white vans but you have to wait until the van is full before it takes off. The price is 10 BRL for both mototaxi and van. If you want to book an entire van for yourself let me know and I will organize it for you for about 80 to 150 BRL.</p>

        <p>It’s a 20-minute walk from the condominium along the ocean—a really nice stroll! There are taxi stands in front, so you could walk there and then take a taxi back. Zona Sul supermarkets also deliver to your doorstep via their app or website. They even have a buffet/restaurant/sushi bar for breakfast and lunch, which is excellent</p>

           <p>
      Alright, first, let me say that the category “Ice Cream” is not at all accurate here. This is a restaurant serving typical Amazonian food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The menu features some interesting dishes—the crab meat is definitely worth a try, and the Jambu sauce might be too, though more for the novelty of a sauce that tingles your mouth. However, I go there for another Brazilian classic: the famous açaí bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      While açaí is often eaten hot and salty as a side dish with fish in the Amazonian region, where the fruit originates, it has conquered the world in its frozen form, served as a dessert or ice cream. Hence the “Ice Cream” label.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: açaí first became popular as an exported product in the U.S., and only afterward was embraced with open arms by the rest of Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, açaí is now everywhere—hundreds of street food vendors and açaí shops sell this originally extremely healthy superfood. I say “originally” because most of what you get today is industrially processed junk, full of guaraná syrup (which has nothing to do with actual guaraná—that’s another story. The syrup is basically just sugar).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this restaurant, however, you still get the real deal. So if you want to experience the true taste of açaí and do something good for your body while you're at it, go there, order an açaí bowl, and be happy. It’s really worth the visit!

          <p>The best bread and baguette can be found at a French bakery named La Bicyclette. They also serve really good breakfast, sandwiches, and cakes. It’s a great place to shop for artisanal cheeses, handmade butter, and more. They also offer delivery with their own <a href="https://delivery.labicyclette.com.br/labicyclette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app</a>.</p>
    <p>They have three locations; one is very close in Leblon, and the main one is next to the Botanical Garden — <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jj4ZD9g2oeaaj5H66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view on map</a>.</p>
    <p>One downside, though: they sell some cakes and breads that haven’t been baked on the same day. Still good—but for the price, a bit cheeky, in my opinion.</p>

          <div class="restaurant-meta">Ipanema · $$ · Burgers</div>
         <p>There are a lot of great burger places in Rio. This one is my favorite because their burgers are truly amazing (smash). They deliver in under half an hour and the burgers arrive piping hot right to your doorstep. It is easy to order via their Google Maps link.</p>

<p>Here is a quick explanation of the different burgers in Rio. There are basically two types of places. One type serves traditional fresh meat patties, smash style or not, like this one. These burgers are on the more expensive side (about 40 BRL each) but resemble the international idea of a classic burger.</p>

<p>Much cheaper and available all over the city is the Brazilian version called X-Tudo. It is a staple for the working class and a favorite late-night snack after a night out because of its affordable price and widespread availability. The name says it all: it is essentially everything in a burger and then some. The meat quality is subpar, with frozen patties, but you get two patties plus ham, bacon, two types of cheese, egg, a myriad of sauces and more. As strange as it sounds, it is definitely worth a try. It is best to eat it before taking a shower or jumping into the ocean because, seriously, it can be difficult to eat one without spilling sauce everywhere.</p>

<p>By the way, you will see that the Brazilian adaptation of food follows a common theme of more of everything. A Brazilian pizza has every type of meat available plus four kinds of cheese and various sauces including ketchup. The Brazilian hot dog can be amazing but also overwhelming because of its many ingredients and the challenge of eating it by hand.</p> </li>

  <p>Rio has plenty of beaches to enjoy. They are amazing and a huge part of the Carioca culture.</p>
  
  <p>Here I will give you a brief summary of the best ones in the area, and which ones serve best for what activities (sport, relaxation, party…).  
    But before, let’s talk about water quality and umbrella rental.  </p>

  </p>

  <p><strong>Water Quality</strong></p>
  <p>Almost all of Rio’s beaches have very good water quality and are safe to enter most of the time. Even beaches in the lagoon near the city center, like Botafogo, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flamengo+Beach,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flamengo Beach</a>, which have long been plagued with pollution, are now increasingly getting better. Personally, I would not enter the water in Botafogo, but Flamengo Beach is worth a visit—not least to see the numerous sea turtles living there.</p>
  <p>To verify water quality and safety, see <a href="http://www.praialimpa.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praia Limpa</a>.</p>
  <p>Note: Yellowish/white foam on the surface is natural algae growth and not harmful—it’s a sign of a productive ecosystem. <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/seafoam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOAA Sea Foam Facts</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Umbrella Rental</strong></p>
  <p>When you go to the beach, you’ll be approached to rent a sun umbrella and beach chairs, which, in my opinion, is nice to have.</p>
  <p>Prices vary, but a reputable place will display a price list. It’ll cost more in summer or on weekends but should not exceed 15–35 BRL for an umbrella and about 15 BRL for a chair.</p>
  <p>You are free to use them as long as you want.</p>

    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vidigal+Beach,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      VIDIGAL BEACH
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>This is the beach closest to your home, just a few-minute walk away. It’s my favourite beach in Rio de Janeiro because of its quiet, secluded nature.
It is almost exclusively used by Vidigal residents, visitors, and the Hotel Sheraton, and does not have many beach vendors, which means it’s perfect for relaxing.
Just like in the Vidigal community/area, crime is not tolerated, so it’s one of the few places in Rio where you can relax and don’t have to watch your stuff like a hawk while entering the water (always good to exercise some caution, though, especially in summer when it gets crowded).
The best time to go is right at or before sunrise (around 6 am) until midday, when the sun disappears behind the Dois Irmãos hill.
One word of caution: when the waves are high, the beach literally disappears or becomes very small. A good rule of thumb is to avoid going down when the stairs leading to the beach are under water.
You do not have to worry, though—the beach has a lifeguard who places flags on the sand to signal whether or not it’s safe that day.</p>

   <h2>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leblon+Beach,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        LEBLON BEACH
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>The second nearest beach, and also a personal favorite due to its relaxing atmosphere (compared to Ipanema or Copacabana, is Leblon beach, just 13 minute sea stroll away. Best spot: between <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Posto+11,+Leblon,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posto 11</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Posto+12,+Leblon,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posto 12</a>.</p>

    <h2>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ipanema+Beach,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        IPANEMA BEACH
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you want more action, Ipanema is the place to go. There will be many beach vendors, so you can sit in the same spot all day, being served all sorts of drinks and food.
Around <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Posto+10,+Ipanema,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posto 10</a> is known for its various sports offerings.
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Posto+9,+Ipanema,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posto 9</a> is a place to see and be seen, whereas a non-stop (wild!) LGBT party atmosphere can be found further down toward Copacabana; just look for the rainbow flags.
At the very end of Ipanema Beach is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arpoador,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arpoador</a>, a famous sunset spot and the best place for surfing in the South Zone. There’s also a hippie market on Sundays, and plenty going on: free yoga at 7 am, beach tennis, surfers, food. It’s a great place to hang out.
A word of caution though: while police are present almost all the time, it can get rowdy and dangerous on hot summer weekends between 3 pm and 6 pm. That’s because the buses from the North Zone terminate here, bringing hordes of often-drunk young people—so tourists are better off avoiding the area then.
Also, on the Arpoador rock there are sometimes criminals trying to take advantage of unsuspecting tourists. If you go there (and you should—it’s definitely an amazing vibe), just don’t stray from the beaten path and stick with the crowds. 

    <h2>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Copacabana+Beach,+Rio+de+Janeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        COPACABANA BEACH
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>To be quite honest, while there are nice spots too, there is no real reason for you to go to Copa beach. It is very touristy, so it attracts a lot of criminals trying to take davantage and it does not offer anything special. Noteable exception is Standup paddling in the area around Fairmonth Hotel <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PthznjzMh6egQfCR9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fairmont Hotel</a>. Very nice, especially during sunrise, but also very crowded. Personally I think nothing beats being alone at Vidigal Beach for sunrise. </p>

    <h2>
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7bB6H7KPcgoZT69u6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        SAO CONRADO
      </a>
    </h2>
   <p>Another nearby beach. The nicest part is the coastal walk, especially around 5 pm to 6 pm, when the sky shows its magnificent colours as you stroll along the shore.</p>

<p>Warning: when the waves are very high, the path is closed, as announced over speakers with an alarm sound.</p>

<p>Sao Conrado itself is a great spot for bodyboarding, but if you just want to relax and swim, the water is a bit too wild, in my opinion. Also, the prime areas can get crowded with people from the nearby Rocinha community.</p>

<p>At the end of the beach is the paragliders’ landing spot from “Pedra Bonita.” I also heard that the beach bar named <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NrGSEg3zKtKmqSax6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musa</a> has a good burger.</p>

    <h2>
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZB3YSRGiCAxn9Mku6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        BARRA BEACH
      </a>
    </h2>
   <p>Barra is a relatively recently developed district, often called the Miami of Rio de Janeiro. It has an extremely long stretch of beach, which means you can find really quiet places there.</p>
<p>There you also find upscale beach clubs, where you can hang out to music and drinks while watching the new rich of Rio. A notable one would be <a href="https://share.google/opbzw1qP4Po1bTJMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K08 Kite Surf Club</a>. The burger there is terrible though.</p>
<p>If you want to go jet skiing, go to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JMTD1xPdkAKeWKcR7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praia dos Amores</a>.</p>

    <section id="foodbeach">
  <p><strong>Food on the Beach</strong></p>
  <p>On pretty much all beaches, except Vidigal beach you’ll be offered a variety of foods and drinks—sometimes overwhelmingly so.</p>
  <p>Here is my advice on what to eat and what to avoid (be sure to read the <a href="#paysafe">Payment Safety section above</a> before paying street vendors).</p>
  <p> Another word of advice: there’s hardly any regulation about who can and cannot sell on the sand, so it’s up to you to choose a vendor who looks presentable, clean, and takes good care of his equipment. Don’t get me wrong—most are like that, but the odd exception pops up, and they’re usually obvious to spot.</p>

  <p><em>Biscoito Globo / Mate Iced Tea</em></p>
  <p>The classic Carioca beach snack is called Biscoito de Globo—a cassava-starch–based, crunchy, airy, very light-tasting treat. It’s more about the experience of the crunch than the flavor, to be honest, but it’s still nice. With that, grab a mate iced tea from the same vendor. It’s the most popular item on the beach, so you’ll see plenty of people selling it. </p>
  <p>Price: around 10–15 BRL each.</p>

  <p><em>Grilled Cheese</em></p>
  <p>A close second is grilled cheese prepared for you on the spot. It’s a delicious snack that is safe to eat, but make sure the cheese has been kept in a cooler and that the equipment and vendor are clean. They often also sell sausages, which aren’t the best and perhaps pose a higher risk of food poisoning.</p>
  <p>Price: around 15 BRL.</p>

  <p><em>Empanadas</em></p>
  <p>Empanadas are stuffed oven baked dumblings, and it’s also a very popular beach food. There are two versions, the Brazilian version (looks like a little cupcake), and the Argentinian version.
The Brazilian version is made with a buttery, crumbly dough, and personally I am not a big fan. I mean, there are pretty amazing Brazilian empanadas, but they are better to try elsewhere. On the beach you will not get the best ones, and they are just too dry and heavy to enjoy on the beach.
A completely different story, and personally my favorite beach food / snack is the legendary, amazing EMPANADA ARGENTINA.
You will see the vendors mostly on Ipanema Beach, because the factory that produces these is in the nearby favela Cantagalo, and they sell out quickly, so they are often hard to get in, e.g., Leblon.
But if you see them you must try. Really good, my favorite is Calabresa (sausage), and tomato and cheese. Nice crispy thin dough with succulent filling. Always fresh, a really good food to enjoy!</p>
  <p>Price: around 12–15 BRL.</p>

  <p><em>Sweet Corn</em></p>
  <p>Spreading an irresistible aroma when you’re close by, you won’t miss them! You can eat it with cheese, melted (fake) butter, etc. I don’t know, but in Europe we almost exclusively eat sweet corn, which is vastly different from what they sell here. The corn here is more starchy, less sweet, and often undercooked. I am not a big fan.
</p>
  <p>Price: around 15–20 BRL.</p>

  <!-- … previous entries … -->

  <p><em>Esfihas</em></p>
  <p>
    Esfihas are the Arabic version of stuffed dough. They can be really good and are safe to eat, but I don’t think the beach vendors make the best ones. The top-quality esfihas come from a food truck near the beginning of Leblon Beach—you should definitely give it a try. Name: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MxXBEpRB2SrtFxT59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safita</a>.
  </p>

  <p><em>More Eats</em></p>
  <p>
    There are many other things to try, and it’s often fun to spot something new and amazing. For example, homemade sandwiches can be really good—just always make sure they’re stored properly, kept cool, and look fresh.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll also find various drinks and even fruit salad sold by a guy dressed like a fruit salad…
  </p>

  <p>
    Around lunchtime, you’ll see styrofoam boxes with complete meals which is a popular working-class lunch. I’ve tried it and had no complaints! Should be around 20–25 BRL max.
  </p>
     <p>Price: around 20- 30 BRL.</p>

  <!-- … next entries … -->
</section>
<p><em>AVOID</em></p>
<p>
  Shrimp on a stick—as tempting as they sometimes look, you have no idea when they were prepared or how they’ve been stored. Sometimes vendors from the North Zone cook them in the morning, then travel three hours to the beach and sell them all day without proper cooling. Best to avoid.
</p>
<p>
  Pre-made caipirinhas—they taste bad, and you have no idea what kind of alcohol they contain. Better to buy a caipirinha from the people who rent umbrellas on the beach.
